				  <h3>Why must I have a full bladder for some ultrasound exam?</h3>
				  <div>
				    <p>Full bladder are required for pelvis and obstetrical ultrasound. Since sound waves use in ultrasound travel better through liquids, a full bladder enables the passage of the sound waves making the anatomy (ovaries and uterus) behind the bladder easier to evaluate .</p>
				  </div>
				  <h3>Why  I can't eat or drink before some ultrasound exams?</h3>
				  <div>
				    <p>Eating , drinking or chewing gum or using mints before and ultrasound introduces air into the stomach and bowel areas, and sound waves use in ultrasound do not penetrate air well. This air or gas makes it harder to evaluate the organs. Plus, some organs contract and can not be visualized if food or drink has been ingested. </p>
